## About Me

I love that data provides endless opportunities to make predictions about people, such as their interests, relationships, heath outcomes. I'm excited to work with a team on projects that have a direct and immediate impact.

I realized data science would be a great fit for my skills and interest while completing my MA in clinical psychology. I was most enthusiastic when I cleaning and analyzing data to figure out how to best answer research questions. I also enjoyed my neuropsychological assessment cases, which involved a process similar to that of data science. I gathered and synthesized information from multiple sources (e.g. interviews, behavioral and cognitive tests) to diagnose patientsâ€™ difficulties and then presenting the findings, rationale, and recommendations to them in a digestible way.

To expand my data analytic skills and learn more about their applications in business, I enrolled at Metis Data Science Bootcamp, a 12-week immersive data science course, where I completed multiple end-to-end data driven projects in Python. The curriculum focused on supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and data visualization. 

## My skills include:
- Python (pandas, numpy, jupyter, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- R
- SQL
- Machine Learning (supervised & unsupervised learning)
- NLP
- Tableau
